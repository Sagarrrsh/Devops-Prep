## Jenkins Questions

### 游릭 Beginner Level

**Q1: What is Jenkins?**
- **Answer:** Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It helps automate building, testing, and deploying applications, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.

**Q2: What are the main features of Jenkins?**
- **Answer:** 
  - Easy installation and configuration
  - Hundreds of plugins available
  - Distributed builds support
  - Easy upgrades
  - Platform independent (Java-based)
  - Web-based GUI

**Q3: What is a Jenkins job/project?**
- **Answer:** A Jenkins job is a runnable task that Jenkins can execute. It contains configuration details like source code location, build triggers, build steps, and post-build actions.

**Q4: What are Jenkins plugins? Name some popular ones.**
- **Answer:** Plugins extend Jenkins functionality. Popular plugins include:
  - Git Plugin (version control)
  - Maven Integration Plugin
  - Pipeline Plugin
  - Docker Plugin
  - Blue Ocean (modern UI)
  - Email Extension Plugin

**Q5: What is Jenkins Workspace?**
- **Answer:** A workspace is a directory on the Jenkins agent where the build job runs. It contains source code, build artifacts, and temporary files for that specific job.

**Q6: What is the difference between Jenkins and Hudson?**
- **Answer:** Hudson was the original project. Jenkins is a fork of Hudson created in 2011 due to disputes over governance. Jenkins became more popular and is actively maintained.

**Q7: What is Jenkins Pipeline? Explain Declarative vs Scripted Pipeline.**
- **Answer:** 
  - **Pipeline:** A suite of plugins supporting continuous delivery pipelines in Jenkins
  - **Declarative Pipeline:** Uses a more structured syntax with predefined sections (pipeline, agent, stages, steps). Easier to read and validate.
  - **Scripted Pipeline:** Uses Groovy syntax, more flexible but complex. Starts with `node` block.

**Q8: What are Jenkins Build Triggers? Name different types.**
- **Answer:** Build triggers determine when a Jenkins job should run:
  - **Poll SCM:** Checks version control periodically
  - **Webhook Triggers:** External systems trigger builds
  - **Build after other projects:** Downstream builds
  - **Build periodically:** Cron-like scheduling
  - **GitHub/GitLab hooks:** Automatic triggers on code changes

**Q9: What is Jenkins Master-Slave architecture?**
- **Answer:** 
  - **Master:** Controls the pipeline, schedules builds, dispatches jobs
  - **Slave/Agent:** Executes build jobs assigned by master
  - Benefits: Distributed builds, parallel execution, platform diversity

**Q10: How do you secure Jenkins?**
- **Answer:**
  - Enable security and authentication
  - Use authorization strategies (Matrix-based, Role-based)
  - Implement HTTPS/SSL
  - Regular updates and security patches
  - Use credentials plugin for sensitive data
  - Network security (firewall, VPN)

**Q11: What is Blue Ocean in Jenkins?**
- **Answer:** Blue Ocean is a modern, intuitive UI for Jenkins pipelines. It provides:
  - Visual pipeline editor
  - Better pipeline visualization
  - Faster navigation
  - Mobile-friendly interface

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }

            steps {
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Q13: How do you handle failures and error handling in Jenkins Pipeline?**
- **Answer:**
  - Use `try-catch` blocks in scripted pipeline
  - `post` sections in declarative pipeline
  - `catchError` step to continue pipeline on failure
  - Conditional execution with `when` directive
  - Retry mechanisms and timeout settings

**Q14: What is Jenkins Shared Library?**
- **Answer:** Shared Libraries allow sharing common pipeline code across multiple projects. They:
  - Promote code reuse
  - Maintain consistency
  - Enable centralized updates
  - Support custom steps and variables

- **Answer:** Remote state stores Terraform state file in a remote location (S3, Azure Blob, etc.). Benefits:
  - Team collaboration
  - State locking
  - Better security
  - Backup and versioning

**Q36: What are Terraform Variables and Outputs?**
- **Answer:**
  - **Variables:** Input parameters for modules/configurations
  - **Outputs:** Return values from modules/configurations
  - Enable parameterization and data sharing between modules

**Q37: What is Terraform Workspace?**
- **Answer:** Workspaces allow managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with the same configuration but separate state files.

**Q38: Difference between Terraform and CloudFormation?**
- **Answer:**
  - **Terraform:** Multi-cloud, HCL syntax, larger community
  - **CloudFormation:** AWS-specific, JSON/YAML, native AWS integration
  - **Terraform:** State management, plan before apply

### 游댮 Advanced Level

**Q39: How do you manage Terraform State locks?**
- **Answer:**
  - Use remote backends with locking (DynamoDB for S3)
  - State locks prevent concurrent modifications
  - Force unlock only when necessary (`terraform force-unlock`)
  - Monitor lock timeouts and deadlocks

**Q40: What are Terraform Data Sources?**
- **Answer:** Data sources fetch information from existing resources not managed by current Terraform configuration:
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["self"]
  
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["myami-*"]
  }
}
```

**Q41: How do you implement Terraform CI/CD pipeline?**
- **Answer:**
  - Version control Terraform configurations
  - Automated `terraform plan` in PR/MR
  - Automated `terraform apply` after approval
  - State file security and backup
  - Environment-specific pipelines
  - Policy validation (Sentinel, OPA)

**Q42: What is Terraform Import?**
- **Answer:** `terraform import` brings existing infrastructure under Terraform management:
```bash
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
```
Requires writing configuration that matches the existing resource.
